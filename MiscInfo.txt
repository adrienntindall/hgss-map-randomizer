Changes Made:
-All warps are randomized (duh) except for Elevators, Mt Moon Square, the Power Plant, and any other scripted warps (falling through holes, etc)
*The player's house, the Newbark Lab, and Mr Pokemon's house are also left unrandomized so the player can get pokeballs at catching tutorial and unlock them for purchase in marts
-It is completable* in badge order up until Red
*Although all seeds I've tested are beatable, I am one person and cannot test every case, please report bugs to me as I probably forgot how a random cave worked and thus messed up a data file because of it
-Natu is gauranteed to be obtainable without the need for badges/hms/anything else. If you catch one at or below level 22, it will know teleport
-Fly and Teleport can be used anywhere, and while in the team rocket costume
-The Guide Gent now loads the full map into your Pokegear
-Kyogre and Groudon now appear in both versions, and will appear without the need of the blue orb or red orb
-The south gate of the Elite 4 memebers' rooms has an escape method now


Known non-game breaking quirks that I enjoy:
-Don't see a gym leader you haven't beaten? They're probably outside their gym, either go find them or change your system's date/time to when they're there.
-Leaving the bug catching contest is very normal
-The rival really doesn't need a name if you just want to skip that part
-There is an unused map that I included in the randomization. It is not as cool as it sounds, but it is my favourite map now.
